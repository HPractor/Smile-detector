Smile Detector using Haarcascade in OpenCV
This project implements a Smile Detector using OpenCV and the Haarcascade method. It employs the pre-trained haarcascade_smile.xml file to identify smiles in real-time through webcam input or on pre-recorded videos/images.

Features
Detects and highlights smiles in real-time.
Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers for efficient smile detection.
Lightweight and easy to integrate with other projects.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV 4.x or later

Setup

Clone this repository:
Copy code:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smile-detector.git  
cd smile-detector  

Install dependencies:
Copy code:
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless  

Download the Haar Cascade XML files:
haarcascade_smile.xml (already included in the repo)

Usage
Run the smile detection script:
Copy code:
python smile_detector.py  
The program will start accessing your webcam. Smile, and the detector will highlight your smile on the video feed.

How It Works
The script uses haarcascade_smile.xml, a pre-trained cascade classifier for smile detection.
OpenCV captures frames from the webcam.
The Haar cascade scans each frame to detect smile patterns and marks them with bounding boxes.

Customization
Adjust detection parameters (like scale factor, min neighbors) in the script to fine-tune performance.
Replace the webcam input with a video file for offline detection.
Example Output

Future Enhancements
Add emotion detection for broader applications.
Combine with deep learning for improved accuracy.
